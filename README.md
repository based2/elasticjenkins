## Overview

### Purpose
This plugin has been created to save queued jobs and builds into a central persistence store.
Elasticsearch is the only available persistence store at this stage of the plugin.
All current and terminated builds status and logs can be retrieve from a single place.
Therefore we can manage and view history of multiple Jenkins, including terminated Jenkins container.

### Overview
Whenever a build is triggered the ElasticJenkins plugin is executed, if the wrapper is enabled.
ElasticJenkins takes the Jenkins master name, which is defined under the management console and the project name.
The status of the build is recorded in Elasticsearch at every stage.
